Known Bugs/Issues
-----------------
* As g_snprintf truncates rather than rounds to nearest (axes that should say "0.5" display "0.4").
* Migrate from cairo text based functions for labels to glyphs based functions.
* Polar plot axes labelling and zoom box images.

Future Proposals
----------------
* Print to tiff.
* Multiple plots.
* Multiple wiggle separated regions.
* click and drag.
* Improved curved fonts on azimuthal labels and polar interpolation.
* Log and Semilog programs.
