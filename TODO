Known Bugs/Issues
-----------------
* Add man pages for gtk:plot:linear and gtk:plot:polar
* (Polar) Poor centering ability.
* (Polar) Occasionally graph goes off the page and only a very zoomed in portion is seen (undiagnosed).
* (Polar) Behaviour when azimuth labels all negative (zooming doesn't occur)

Future Proposals
----------------
* (Linear) Wiggle seperation between disconnected domains/ranges of multiple plots.
* (Linear) Click and drag.
* (Polar) Improved curved fonts on azimuthal labels and polar interpolation.
* Log and Semilog programs.
