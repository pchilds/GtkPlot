The Debian Package libgtkplot
----------------------------

This package is developed from a source tree that contains versions for both gtk+2 and gtk+3.
Run './reversion.sh' from the root directory to convert the files into the right format before creating the debian archive (with arguements gtk_major_dependency, gtk_api_revision, library_current_version, library_age, library_revision).
