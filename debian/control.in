Package: libgtkplot-@PLOT_GTK_MAJOR@-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libgtkplot-@PLOT_GTK_MAJOR@ (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Provides headers for the libgtkplot-@PLOT_GTK_MAJOR@ package
 libgtkplot-@PLOT_GTK_MAJOR@ makes available to gtk+@PLOT_GTK_MAJOR@ programs, a linear and polar
 plotting widget. The widget features multiplot capability, zoom
 control, smart range setting and mouse location tracking.
 Processing is optimised towards speed for large data sets as
 commonly occurs in scientific applications and outputs to a neat
 publication ready format.
